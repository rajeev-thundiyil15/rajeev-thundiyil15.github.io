        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Rajeev Thundiyil and I am a recent computer science graduate from UC Riverside. I have a strong passion for front-end development and I specialize in using React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS to create beautiful and responsive websites and applications.

          During my time at UC Riverside, I learned the foundations of computer science and honed my skills in various programming languages and tools. I had the opportunity to work on a few front-end development projects that allowed me to apply my skills in creating user-friendly and intuitive interfaces. I was also able to work in teams and develop my collaboration skills, which I believe are essential in the software development industry.
          
          Aside from front-end development, I have recently been exploring the world of databases and have been learning SQL and database management on the side. I believe that databases play a critical role in software development, and I am excited to deepen my knowledge in this area.
          
          In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new technologies and exploring the latest trends in software development. I am always looking for new opportunities to grow my skills and take on new challenges.
          
          Thank you for taking the time to read my bio, and I hope to have the opportunity to work with you in the future!</p>
